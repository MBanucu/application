		Since August 2025, I have been unemployed and looking for work.
		Furthermore, I have been without a permanent residence and homeless since spring 2019.
		I like to sleep in a tent, in a car, in a trailer, at friends' or family's places, in frost protection shelters for the homeless, or in homeless accommodations.
		I have no desired salary to buy emotions with money after work; instead, I aim to be paid with emotions during work.
		I demand that working under the influence of legal drugs such as alcohol and exorphins at the workplace not be permitted.
