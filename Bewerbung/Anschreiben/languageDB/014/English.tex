		In my many years of experience as a delivery driver for various companies such as Amazon Flex (2020–2022), Lieferando (2020–2021), Durstexpress (2020), Wolt Logistics (2024), and flaschenpost (2024), I have gained comprehensive knowledge in the efficient delivery of packages, food, and beverages.
		My focus has always been on punctuality, customer satisfaction, and the safe handling of goods—whether using my own car or scooter.
		I am well-versed in the use of navigation apps, route optimization, and managing time-critical deliveries, which allows me to work calmly and goal-oriented even under high workload pressure.
		This practical experience makes me a reliable team member for your delivery service, where I would gladly contribute my flexibility and commitment.
