		In May 2024, I was supposed to start working at Lieferando in Frankfurt.
		I received an employment contract, but I didn't get any work.
		I waited for induction appointments and regularly inquired about why I wasn't receiving any dates.
		After about a month, the final response came that the contract would be retroactively canceled, with the reasoning that the works council had voted against my hiring.
		It was stipulated in Article 11 of the employment contract that the employment relationship is subject to the suspensive condition that the works council must approve my hiring.
		This has led to various complications.
		To avoid this in the future, I demand half of the monthly salary in advance, 15 days before the start of the activity.
