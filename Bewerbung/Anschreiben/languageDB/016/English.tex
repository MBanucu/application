		Since August 2025, I have been unemployed and looking for work.
		Furthermore, I have been without a permanent residence and homeless since spring 2019.
		I like to sleep in a tent, in a car, in a trailer, at friends' or family's places, in frost protection shelters for the homeless, or in homeless accommodations.
		I have no desired salary to buy emotions with money after work; instead, I aim to be paid with emotions during work.
		I demand that working under the influence of legal drugs such as alcohol and exorphins at the workplace not be permitted.

		In May 2024, I was supposed to start working at Lieferando in Frankfurt.
		I received an employment contract, but I didn't get any work.
		I waited for induction appointments and regularly inquired about why I wasn't receiving any dates.
		On June 12, 2024, the final response came that the contract would be retroactively canceled, with the reasoning that the works council had voted against my hiring.
		It was stipulated in Article 11 of the employment contract that the employment relationship is subject to the suspensive condition that the works council must approve my hiring.
		This has led to various complications.
		To avoid this in the future, I demand half of the monthly salary in advance, 15 days before the start of the activity.

        Currently, I sleep in my 20-year-old Citroen C2 and spend my days in libraries, parks, and day shelters for the homeless.
		You don't believe that someone can voluntarily live in such a situation and feel better than in an apartment?
		Then check out my YouTube channel \usekomavar{youtube} and my website for the homeless \usekomavar{christlicheObdachlosenHilfe}.
		Maybe I can convince you there.

        Please be aware that in the resume there are listed only jobs and projects that I made money with.
		In the private area I already have implemented many small projects in different languages and with different tools (this application is partly being built by a shell script).

        I am a flexible human being and I generally like to solve technical problems, optimize systems and explore, understand and learn new things.
		I am embracing new challenges with open arms.
		Due to my ability to understand fast I have no problems working in to new ranges of tasks.
		Even if the workload is high I always keep having the overview and I work with constant concentration and keep being goal-driven.

        In my many years of experience as a delivery driver for various companies such as Amazon Flex (2020–2022), Lieferando (2020–2021), Durstexpress (2020), Wolt Logistics (2024), and flaschenpost (2024), I have gained comprehensive knowledge in the efficient delivery of packages, food, and beverages.
		My focus has always been on punctuality, customer satisfaction, and the safe handling of goods—whether using my own car or scooter.
		I am well-versed in the use of navigation apps, route optimization, and managing time-critical deliveries, which allows me to work calmly and goal-oriented even under high workload pressure.
		This practical experience makes me a reliable team member for your delivery service, where I would gladly contribute my flexibility and commitment.

        Due to my multiannual experience as a software developer I was able to learn much about the practical workflow in the software development area.
		My experience in software development (for companies) mainly consists of general development, where an already existing system was changed differentially to improve it, for example solving bugs or adding and changing features.

        I have knowledge of the most common object-oriented language concepts, software development tools (version contol systems, IDE-, CI-tools) and practices (TDD, Scrum).

        I would be delighted to receive an invitation to a negotiation regarding a training contract or employment contract.
